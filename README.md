## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working as an on-device developer at Samsung Electronics. My job involves analyzing data collected from products and developing AI services to run on-device.
As a developer who enjoys learning and sharing new things, I always pursue challenges and growth. Specializing in one field is great, but I strive to become a generalist. I enjoy studying various domains, integrating their knowledge, and applying them to create innovative services.

I was responsible for educating student developers, then I transitioned to developing Linux-based platforms, conducting system performance analysis and optimization, and developing Android applications. Currently, I am growing as an AI developer.

The languages I frequently use are C, C++, Python. And i am a developer who love linux, open-source, s/w architecture

Join me in exploring new technologies and developing innovative solutions! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or have any questions or suggestions.
